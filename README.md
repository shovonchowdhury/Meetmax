# React + Vite

This is a Social Media Demo website named Meetmax that responsive as well. This project have mainly 2 part.....

1. Auth: For authentication process i used firebase authentication. This part is divided into 3 features.
   a. Sign Up
   b. Sign In
   C. Forgot Password System

2. Feed: This is the main section(Home) of the project. User can't access the page without signin or signup as i set it into a private route. There are some features like...
   a. Create a post: Here i shown a demo that how a post can create although i havn't use any backend.
   b. Like & comment: I introduced like & comment interaction.
   c. Story : The story section can view with swipe. Here i used Swiper method.

Challenges i have faced: I tried loader() for data fetching....which troubled me to live my project. Then i used useEffect() to fetch data.
